	<p>The KTM RC is like any other sportsbike <em>Beautiful & Elegant</em> <strong>but</strong> theres something 		extraordinary in it,and that is its <strong>Mileage</strong>.With a mileage of <strong>45-50 Kmpl</strong> and 		having a maintainanace as low as a pulsar,that means only Rs.1000-1200 every time you take it to service,this has 		been the best in its class.And the best part is,it wont require service before <strong>8 months</strong>.</p>
